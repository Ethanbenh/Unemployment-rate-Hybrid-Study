# Unemployment-rate-Hybrid-Study

Unemployment remains one of the most critical indicators of a country's economic performance, reflecting not only labor market fluctuations but also deeper structural changes within the economy. In the European context, despite significant disparities across Member States, it remains a central policy concern. The euro area’s unemployment rate stood at 6.2% in January 2025, with countries like Spain and Greece still grappling with persistently high rates.

In this context, the ability to anticipate unemployment trends has become a strategic priority for governments, economic institutions, and investors. Reliable forecasts enable timely policy adjustments in employment, training, and fiscal planning, while also informing private sector decisions.

Recent research underlines the strong interplay between unemployment and other macroeconomic variables such as GDP, inflation, and social cohesion. As such, improving forecasting accuracy is not merely a statistical challenge—it is a key lever for proactive policy design. With the growing complexity of economic data, traditional econometric models are increasingly being complemented by machine learning and deep learning methods.

This study investigates how modern predictive approaches can enhance our ability to forecast unemployment, focusing on the integration of historical time-series models with advanced neural architectures.
